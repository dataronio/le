   I started this project as a laboratory work being first year student of
Yaroslavl State University in 1993. That time I worked on a BESTA machine
under some kind of Unix. It had 8M of memory and 14 terminals plugged in.
(That was fun :) And it had no good editor, except vi... Honestly, that
time I did not know that emacs or internet exist :)

   The first version of the editor could do not too much -- load a file,
browse, insert, delete, save -- that's all. Since that, the editor was
almost completely rewritten in C++. Some old code is still there, since I
don't know what to do with it. Now it become quite a powerful editor and I
decided at last to publish it under GPL and did it in early 1997. (See
FEATURES for brief description of capabilities)

   I understand that there are many other text editors out there, but I
used to my own editor and some my friends told me that the editor is
actually better than many others.
